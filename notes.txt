Staff list
- update form
- change order of list 

Work
- in Production toggle
- Are you sure? Prompt - This will overwrite the current inProduction section on Home
- change order of list

Same logic for work and staff
How?
1. Drag and drop?
- most user intuitive
- difficult to implement?
2. List position number?
E.g. options:
Save this work at the top of the list
Save this work at the bottom
Save this work after selected
Selected = '....'
- intuitive
- easier to implement

Note:
List order changes can be made outside of form too (edit button, change order button)
