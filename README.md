Update IMTV

A backend application to allow users to edit a media portfolio website. Using Node.js and MySQL, this CRUD application makes GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE requests to a separate API application. A separate frontend page then retrieves the changes with a GET request, updating video links, images, blog posts and more.
