Update IMTV

A backend application to allow users to edit the IMTV homepage. Using Node.js and MySQL, this CRUD application makes GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE requests to an online Heroku API. The user interface allows users to make these alterations to the IMTV Homepage in an ergonomic way, without the need for programmer assistance. Changes are then retrieved and shown as the MySQL database updates, thanks to the API.
