it s hard to explain from here tho

Ha. Is this in the controller?
Alexiis — Yesterday at 16:52
yes
martinrombach88 — Yesterday at 16:52
And its async.. cool

console log the req after ur Multer
u will see bunch of info
if u console log the req coming from the parameter of the function u won t see the file infos
that;s what I remember, Multer is bit tricky sometime

Yeah looks like it. I haven't got multer working in the controller yet, maybe I need an async function to do it. It'll be a little tricky, but once its done one of my most important functions is ready
Thanks man. I'll study that code

I bet it needs to be Async, as it may take time to save the file
